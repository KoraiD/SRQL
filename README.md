# SRQL

This is my onboarding project for Rollbar.

The goal is to create a Chrome Extension which provides a drag and drop visual query builder for *RQL* - [Rollbar Query Language](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/rql).

# Resources:

* https://docs.rollbar.com/
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/interactjs/v/1.10.1
* https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/

# Tools:

As a development tool, I use [VS Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

The only other tool you will need to try is [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), the Continous Code Improvement Platform - try it for free! :sunglasses:

# Current ToDo list:
- [x] Remove unused libraries
- [x] Use Rollbar as Error Monitoring and log collector tool
- [ ] Apply URL matching syntax - to allow popup only at the RQL page
- [ ] Implement new JS dependencies
- [ ] Add basic query components
- [ ] Build query assembly box and
